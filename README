Okay, so this is going to scan all the routers in a list of routers...
    # Idea: obtain routers from bgp
It gets the ARP tables from each of these routers.
    # These should be very similar.
    # Ignore locally-administered MAC addresses!
Determine which of these are access points
    # Stop here, get this done.
